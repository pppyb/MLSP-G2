This is the data corresponding to the Blind Source Separation project for 11755 F23.
You are provided with 3 .mat files. These can be read in MATLAB or python (using scipy/mat73 libraries)
Each mat file contains HDEMG data from the Tibialis anterior muscle (close to shin). The data corresponds to participants holding a force level (steady force 1) and ramping up the force level (increasing force 1 and increasing force 2). You have to identify the number of unique sources (motor units) for each of these conditions.
Each mat file has following 2 arrays:
File
-	Out_mat: a 64 x # of samples array, with the time series data corresponding to the HDEMG signals
-	Grid_crds: a 64 x 2 array, with the spatial location of each electrode, the unit is in mm. This is useful if you are planning to incorporate spatial filters in your method.
